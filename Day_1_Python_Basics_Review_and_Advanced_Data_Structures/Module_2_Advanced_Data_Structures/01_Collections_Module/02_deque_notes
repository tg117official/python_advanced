A deque (short for "double-ended queue") in Python is like a list but more flexible. It's part of the `collections` module and allows you to add and remove items from both ends (front and back) very quickly.

Key Features:
1. Fast operations at both ends:
   - Adding or removing items at the beginning or end of a deque is faster than with a regular list.
2. Useful for specific scenarios:
   - Deques are great when you need to process items in the order they arrive (like a queue) or need to manage a fixed-size collection.

Where to Use:
- When you need a queue or stack.
- When you need to add/remove items from both ends frequently.
- To maintain a fixed-size collection (like a sliding window).

Example:

from collections import deque

# Create a deque
dq = deque()

# Add items to the end
dq.append(10)
dq.append(20)

# Add items to the beginning
dq.appendleft(5)

print(dq)  # Output: deque([5, 10, 20])

# Remove items from the end
dq.pop()

# Remove items from the beginning
dq.popleft()

print(dq)  # Output: deque([10])


Why is it helpful?
Deques are optimized for operations at the start and end, unlike lists which can be slow when inserting or removing items at the beginning.
