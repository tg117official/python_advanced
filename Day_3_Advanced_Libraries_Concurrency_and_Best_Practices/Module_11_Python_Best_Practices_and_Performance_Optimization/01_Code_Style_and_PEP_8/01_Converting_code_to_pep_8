To convert your Python script to follow PEP 8 style guidelines, you can use the following steps:



1. Use an Automatic Formatter
Several tools can help you automatically format your Python script to conform to PEP 8. Here are some popular options:

#a. `black`
Black is an uncompromising code formatter for Python.
- Install: `pip install black`
- Format your script: `black your_script.py`

#b. `autopep8`
This tool is specifically designed to format Python code to conform to PEP 8.
- Install: `pip install autopep8`
- Format your script:
  bash
  autopep8 your_script.py --in-place --aggressive --aggressive
  autopep8 demo.py --in-place --aggressive --aggressive



#c. `flake8`
While `flake8` is primarily a linter, it highlights areas that deviate from PEP 8.
- Install: `pip install flake8`
- Lint your script: `flake8 your_script.py`



2. Manual Steps
If you want to manually conform to PEP 8, check the following key guidelines:

#Indentation
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

#Maximum Line Length
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

#Blank Lines
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
- Use a single blank line to separate methods inside a class.

#Imports
- Place all imports at the top of the file.
- Use separate lines for each import.

  # Good
  import os
  import sys

  # Bad
  import os, sys


#String Quotes
- Use consistent quotes, either single (`'`) or double (`"`), throughout the file.

#Spaces
- Avoid extraneous whitespace:

  # Good
  a = 1
  b = [1, 2, 3]

  # Bad
  a=1
  b = [1,2,3]


#Naming Conventions
- Follow snake_case for function and variable names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Constants should be in ALL_CAPS.

#Comments
- Write clear and descriptive comments.
- Use `#` for single-line comments.

#Function Annotations
- If applicable, add type hints to function definitions:

  def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b




3. Check PEP 8 Compliance
After applying the formatting, validate compliance with a linter:
- Run `flake8` or `pylint` to check for remaining issues.
  bash
  flake8 your_script.py
  pylint your_script.py




4. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Most modern IDEs support PEP 8 checking and automatic formatting. For example:
- VS Code: Install extensions like Python or Pylance, and enable PEP 8 formatting.
- PyCharm: Automatically checks and fixes PEP 8 issues as you code.
